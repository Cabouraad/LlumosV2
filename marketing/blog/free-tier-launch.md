## The Rise of AI Search—And Why You Can't Afford to Ignore It

ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews are fundamentally changing how people discover brands. Instead of scrolling through 10 blue links, users now ask AI assistants direct questions like "What's the best CRM for small businesses?" or "Top marketing automation tools for startups."

**Here's the problem:** Most businesses have no idea whether AI is recommending them—or sending customers straight to competitors.

That's why we built Llumos. And today, we're excited to announce our **Free Tier**—giving every business the ability to monitor their AI search visibility without spending a dime.

## How Llumos Free Tier Compares to Competitors

The AI search monitoring space is heating up, but most solutions are priced for enterprise budgets:

| Platform | Starting Price | Prompts Included | Free Option |
|----------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Profound AI** | $500-1,200/mo | Varies | ❌ No |
| **Conductor AI** | $600+/mo | Limited | ❌ No |
| **Otterly.ai** | $99/mo | 10 prompts | ❌ No |
| **Llumos** | **$0/mo** | 5 prompts | ✅ **Yes** |

### Why We Offer a Free Tier

We believe every business—from solo founders to growing startups—deserves visibility into how AI platforms perceive their brand. You shouldn't need a $500/month budget to answer a simple question: *"Is ChatGPT recommending me or my competitors?"*

## Why AI Search Visibility Matters for Your Business

### The Shift Is Already Happening

- **40% of Gen Z** prefers using TikTok and AI assistants over Google for search
- **ChatGPT processes 1.5+ billion queries monthly**—many with commercial intent
- **AI Overviews** now appear in 30%+ of Google searches, often above traditional results

### What Poor AI Visibility Costs You

When AI platforms don't mention your brand, you lose:

1. **Discovery opportunities** — Prospects never learn you exist
2. **Credibility signals** — AI recommendations carry implicit trust
3. **Market share** — Competitors mentioned instead capture demand
4. **Sales pipeline** — Fewer inbound leads from AI-influenced buyers

### The Compounding Problem

Unlike traditional SEO, AI visibility compounds quickly. If AI learns to recommend your competitors today, those patterns reinforce over time. Early monitoring lets you identify and address gaps before they become entrenched.
